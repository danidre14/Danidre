        <h5>The Gist</h5>
        <p>Basically, do not do anything that may take advantage of my creations. If you have no idea what is good or
            bad, please e-mail me before you do something!
            <br />
            Generally, I want you to cite and credit me and my work properly; do not exploit, hack, or take advantage of
            my work; be fair to other people using my websites; and be kind.
            <br />
            As for YouTubers, promoters, and journalists, generally feel free to share my stuff under fair use, if said
            work is publicly available... just, again, credit me fully, and provide links to this site. I don't want
            anyone getting confused or misdirected.</p>
